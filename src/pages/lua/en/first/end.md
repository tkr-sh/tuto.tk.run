So, now the only thing that remains is printing the number of tries.

We previously incremented it just after getting the user data with

```lua
number_of_tries = number_of_tries + 1
```

But know, we would like to print a congratulation message and at the same time, how many tries did it take ?

It's time to learn the last operator before the end of this first game:

`..`: Concatenates 2 values. 

<div class="runner">

```lua
print("It's been " .. 4 .. " years")
```

</div>

With that, in mind, we can create a nice message:

```lua
print("You won in " .. number_of_tries .. " tries!")
```

And here is FINALLY our game:

---

<div class="runner">

```lua
number_of_tries = 0
number_to_guess = random(1, 100)

print("Try to guess the random number between 1 and 100!")

repeat
	user_guess = tonumber(read())
	number_of_tries = number_of_tries + 1

	if number_to_guess < user_guess then
		print("The number is lower!")
	end

	if number_to_guess > user_guess then
		print("The number is higher!")
	end
until user_guess == number_to_guess

print("You won in " .. number_of_tries .. " tries!")
```

</div>

## WOW.

Wow! Isn't it ?

You're ready to become a programmer now :) !

## Is it over ?

Yes and no.

Sadly, I oversimplified a thing: usually you can't execute `read` and `random` like that. Lua likes to put "built-in"s function in some categories: `math` (for mathematicals functions), `io` (for input / output interactions), `os` (to interact with your operating system), ...

And therefore, when you want to use specific functions that are part of a category, you need to call them like `category.the_function()`

In our case, `random` is part of the `math` category, and `read` is part of the `io` category. `print` and `tonumber` are global so you don't need to specify anything

<div class="runner">

```lua
number_of_tries = 0
number_to_guess = math.random(1, 100)

print("Try to guess the random number between 1 and 100!")

repeat
	user_guess = tonumber(io.read())
	number_of_tries = number_of_tries + 1

	if number_to_guess < user_guess then
		print("The number is lower!")
	end

	if number_to_guess > user_guess then
		print("The number is higher!")
	end
until user_guess == number_to_guess

print("You won in " .. number_of_tries .. " tries!")
```

</div>

## Congratulations, you have now finished your first Lua program! ðŸŽ‰

Now that you have the basis, we will try to improve our current game to add new functionnalities, and we are going to learn new things on the way!
