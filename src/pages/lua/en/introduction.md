This tutorial is a tutorial for the programming language "Lua".

This tutorial is meant for people that never programmed and that want to learn how to or are just curious.

This guide doesn't require any previous knowledge in programming, mathematics, physics or algorithmics. The only thing that is important is a basic knowledge in english (knowing words like "if", "else", "end", "repeat", "while", ...).

One thing that I really advice you to do is: DON'T USE ANY AI. Try to learn everything by yourself and with this tutorial. This tutorial was made so you learn things in a specific order and it doesn't require any AI.

This guide will let you run your own Lua program in the website to interactively learn the language, so no need to worry about "how do I install Lua ?" for now.

So without waiting more, _**let's jump in!**_

Some people may ask why this is about Lua and not Python or Javascript, here is my answer to that:

## Python

- Python has just way to many stuff compared to Lua. Good luck explaining all the keywords to someone that has never programmed.
- Good luck explaining why you cannot indent with spaces and tabs (and what even are tabs `\t`))
- Good luck explaining to people that they need to install a virtual environment just to run their program with external dependency
- Good luck to explain What is error handling with try/except ?
- Good luck to explain what you can either do: for loop, list comprehensions or map ? And what does "lambda" means ?
- Good luck explaining what OOP is all about and why is it "useful".
- Also good luck for the walrus operator `:=`
- Also you have to explain that there are assignment operators for almost all operators (`+=`, `-=`, etc..)

Like... all of this is not impossible to teach. But it's just some more stuff that you don't have to think about in Lua.

## Javascript

- Javascript dude
