This tutorial is a tutorial for the programming language "Lua".

This tutorial is meant for people that never programmed and that want to learn how to or are just curious.

This guide doesn't require any previous knowledge in programming, mathematics, physics or algorithmics. The only thing that is important is a basic knowledge in english (knowing words like "if", "else", "end", "repeat", "while", ...).

This guide will let you run your own Lua program to interactively learn the language.

So without waiting more, _**let's jump in!**_

For techincal people:

Some people may ask why this is about Lua and not Python or Javascript, here is my answer to that:

## Python

- Python has just way to many stuff compared to Lua. Good luck explaining all the keywords to someone that has never programmed.
- Good luck explaining why you cannot indent with spaces and tabs (and what even are tabs (\t))
- Good luck explaining to people that they need to install a virtual environment just to run their program with external dependency
- Good luck explaining what OOP is all about and why is it "useful".

## Javascript

- Javascript dude
